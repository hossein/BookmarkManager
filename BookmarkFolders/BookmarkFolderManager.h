/// Manages bookmark folders.
/// The special folder '0, Unsorted Bookmarks' is the parent of all other folders. Its parent is -1.
///
/// Relationship with FileArchives:
///   Each BookmarkFolder can specify its FileArchive so that the bookmarks in that folder store
///   their files in the file archive. However, there is the question of how folders' layout should
///   look like in each file archive. We have three choices:
///   A. Don't reflect BookmarkFolder layout on filesystem folders.
///   B. Reflect the full absolute path of BookmarkFolder on each file archive on the filesystem.
///   C. Reflect the relative path of BookmarkFolder on the file archive.
///   We don't want to choose A because it is unintuitive. We actually discontinued the use of the
///   'f/fi/file' prefixed layout in FAM because it was unintuitive and anyway nowadays OSes support
///   folders with lots of files in them.
///   The difference between B and C is, if we have a BookmarkFolder layout like this:
///     Root (arch0) --> F1 --> F2 --> F3 (arch1) --> F4
///   Then using layout B, arch1's directory layout will look like this:
///     C:\Arch1 (empty folder)\F1 (empty folder)\F2 (empty folder)\F3\{F4 folder and other Files}
///   But with layout C arch1's directory will not contain unnecessary parent dirs:
///     C:\Arch1\{F4 folder and other Files}
///   Layout C is the most intuitive layout. So we use it, but we have to solve some problems first.
///   Suppose we have the following BookmarkFolder layout:
///     Root (arch0) --> F1 --> F2 (arch1) --> F3 --> F4 (arch0) --> F5
///   Then in this case the directory of arch0 on the filesystem will contain both F1 and F5 as its
///   children, while in reality F5 is logically a grandparent of F1. To solve it we can disallow
///   setting a FileArchive on a BookmarkFolder when that same FileArchive was set on an ancestor
///   BookmarkFolder. With some thinking we can conclude that this avoids the mentioned problem.
///   But there is a more general problem.
///   Suppose this second BookmarkFolder layout, which does not cause the previous problem:
///     Root (arch0) --+-> F1 --> F2 (arch1) --> FN
///                    \--> F4 --> F5 (arch1) --> FN
///   Then arch1 will contain two separate folders, maybe with separate functions, and maybe with
///   the same name. The final solution that comes to mind to prevent all of these issues is:
///   We let each FileArchive be specified as the FileArchive OF AT MOST ONE BookmarkFolder.
///   The mentioned problems will not happen then. However there is the problem that the user
///   can specify the same filesystem folder for two or more file archives but that's another story
///   and will be prevented in FileArchiveManager.
//TODO: Do we currently prevent creating folders having the same archive as Unsorted thingie?
