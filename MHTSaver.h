//TODO:
//- MHTSaver can't save single files
//- Strip JS.

class QTimer;
class QNetworkReply;
class QNetworkAccessManager;

/// Save URLs as MHT files!
///     This class is designed to suffice NOT-SO-IMPORTANT usages. It may not be suitable for
///     exact-accuracy saving needs.
///     It always produces an mhtml file data; i.e it even wraps images in this format.
/// Shortcomings:
///     1. Doesn't support any encoding other than UTF8
///     2. Doesn't smartly guess file types; just looks at their content type and file extension.
///        (partially does this actually, e.g if js/css files have text/html content type it
///        will fix it, but doesn't do the same thing for e.g images having text/html mime type.)
///        UPDATE: Now we use QMimeDatabase to correctly guess the mime type of unknown files on
///        based on extension and contents.
///     3. Doesn't have a timer or something to abort slow or stalled network operations.
///        We can use an e.g 20sec timer to abort operations with slow/stalled progresses during
///        the last 10 seconds. Update: But we DON'T. Maybe if we aren't receiving a qreply's
///        finished signal, we are just receiving a big file. And if it gets stalled for a long
///        time, we let the system time it out itself. Anyway if there is any such timer, it has to
///        record progress or number of received bytes and judge according to that, not time alone.
///        However that is for single replies alone. We do have a timer that controls overall
///        receiving time of the whole page. It should be set to a big value to allow for large file
///        downloads.
///     4. The HTML and CSS parsers are very simple, don't skip comments and use simple regexps.
///     5. Doesn't strip scripts.
///     6. Doesn't load resources that are additionally loaded in scripts, or change DOM after
///        loading a page; only a browser can do that.
///     7. Redirections support is limited and is only done correctly for the main page. Although
///        the redirect targets are being fetched and saved, they are NOT displayed e.g in case of
///        pictures, because we neither modify the urls in the html/css files nor do we save the
///        redirect locations under the old addresses. Ideally we had to do both, i.e convert the
///        redirect targets to some `urn:` form and use them.
///     8. I DID NOT GUARANTEE CORRECTNESS OF %-encoded URLS and other similar issues. I didn't
///        study QUrl<->QString conversions thoroughly about how to treat the encoding issues.
